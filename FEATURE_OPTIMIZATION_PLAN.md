## ❌ FEATURES TO REMOVE (Currently Created but Not in Optimal Set)

### Category 1: Geographic Clustering (STEP 3) - REMOVE ENTIRELY ❌
```python
# File: 03_feature_engineering.py, Lines 218-277
Geographic_Cluster                           # Noisy K-means clustering
Arıza_Sayısı_12ay_Cluster_Avg               # Leaky (uses future data)
Tekrarlayan_Arıza_90gün_Flag_Cluster_Avg   # Leaky (uses future data)
MTBF_Gün_Cluster_Avg                        # Circular logic

Rationale for removal:
- Geographic clustering on X,Y coordinates produces noisy patterns
- Distribution networks are LINEAR (power lines), not clustered points
- Cluster aggregations create data leakage risk
- Better alternative: İlçe (district) - clear, interpretable, domain-meaningful
```

### Category 2: Redundant Failure Rate Features (STEP 4) - REMOVE ❌
```python
# File: 03_feature_engineering.py, Lines 283-323
Failure_Rate_Per_Year                        # Redundant (Toplam_Arıza / Ekipman_Yaşı)
Recent_Failure_Intensity                     # Leaky (uses Arıza_Sayısı_3ay)
Failure_Acceleration                         # Leaky (uses Arıza_Sayısı_6ay)

Rationale for removal:
- Failure_Rate_Per_Year: Tree models learn this automatically from raw features
- Recent_Failure_Intensity: Uses 3-month data (may include post-cutoff)
- Failure_Acceleration: Uses 6-month data (may include post-cutoff)
```

### Category 3: Equipment Class Aggregations (STEP 7) - REMOVE ENTIRELY ❌
```python
# File: 03_feature_engineering.py, Lines 382-418
Arıza_Sayısı_12ay_Class_Avg                 # Leaky (uses 12M window)
MTBF_Gün_Class_Avg                          # Circular logic
Ekipman_Yaşı_Yıl_Class_Avg                  # Not predictive
Yas_Beklenen_Omur_Orani_Class_Avg           # Not predictive
Failure_vs_Class_Avg                         # Derived from leaky feature

Rationale for removal:
- Class averages create target leakage (using class to predict class members)
- Circular reasoning (if equipment X is in class Y, using Y's average to predict X)
- Models learn class patterns automatically from Equipment_Class_Primary feature
```

### Category 4: Weak Interaction Features (STEP 8) - REMOVE/REPLACE ❌
```python
# File: 03_feature_engineering.py, Lines 420-443
Age_Failure_Interaction                      # Uses leaky Arıza_Sayısı_12ay

Rationale for removal:
- Uses Arıza_Sayısı_12ay which may include post-cutoff data
- Better alternative: AgeRatio_Recurrence_Interaction (uses Lifetime count instead)
```

## ✅ FEATURES TO ADD (Missing from Current Pipeline)

### TIER 4: MTBF Enhancement Features (2 features)

#### 1. MTBF_InterFault_Trend
```python
# Description: Recent MTBF / Historical MTBF
# Purpose: Detect equipment degradation over time
# Calculation:
#   - Recent MTBF = Average of last 50% of inter-fault times
#   - Historical MTBF = Average of first 50% of inter-fault times
#   - Trend = Recent / Historical
# Interpretation:
#   - < 1.0 = Degrading (failures accelerating)
#   - = 1.0 = Stable
#   - > 1.0 = Improving (failures slowing down)
# Missing: ~20% (equipment with < 4 faults)
```

#### 2. MTBF_InterFault_StdDev
```python
# Description: Standard deviation of inter-fault times
# Purpose: Measure failure timing predictability
# Calculation: Std dev of days between consecutive faults
# Interpretation:
#   - Low StdDev = Consistent, predictable failure pattern
#   - High StdDev = Erratic, unpredictable failures
# Missing: ~20% (equipment with < 2 faults)
```

### TIER 8: Derived Interaction Features (2 features)

#### 3. Overdue_Factor
```python
# Description: Days since last failure / MTBF_InterFault_Gün
# Purpose: Detect equipment "overdue" for next failure
# Calculation: Son_Arıza_Gun_Sayisi / MTBF_InterFault_Gün
# Interpretation:
#   - < 1.0 = Not yet due for next failure based on pattern
#   - = 1.0 = Due for failure based on historical pattern
#   - > 1.0 = Overdue (higher risk of imminent failure)
# Missing: ~23% (equipment with no failures or MTBF = 0)
```

#### 4. AgeRatio_Recurrence_Interaction
```python
# Description: Age ratio × Failure count (compound aging + use risk)
# Purpose: Capture interaction between lifecycle position and failure history
# Calculation: Yas_Beklenen_Omur_Orani × Toplam_Arıza_Sayisi_Lifetime
# Interpretation:
#   - High value = Old equipment with many failures (compound risk)
#   - Low value = Young equipment with few failures (low risk)
# Missing: 0% (both components always available)
```

### OPTIONAL: Additional Enhancement Features

#### 5. Age_Lifecycle_Stage (Categorical)
```python
# Description: Lifecycle stage based on age ratio
# Purpose: Categorical representation of equipment lifecycle
# Categories:
#   - 'Infant': Yas_Beklenen_Omur_Orani < 0.15 (first 15% of life)
#   - 'Mature': 0.15 ≤ ratio < 0.75 (main operational period)
#   - 'Aging': 0.75 ≤ ratio < 0.95 (approaching end-of-life)
#   - 'End-of-Life': ratio ≥ 0.95 (critical replacement needed)
# Missing: 0%
```

#### 6. Tek_Neden_Flag (if not already exists)
```python
# Description: Single cause accounts for ≥80% of faults
# Purpose: Identify stable failure mode (single dominant cause)
# Calculation: 1 if max(cause_count) / total_faults >= 0.80, else 0
# Interpretation:
#   - 1 = Stable, predictable failure mode (good for maintenance planning)
#   - 0 = Multiple failure modes (complex degradation)
# Missing: 0%
```
