"""
DATA LEAKAGE REMOVAL
Turkish EDAŞ PoF Prediction Project

Purpose:
- Identify and remove features that would cause data leakage
- Data leakage = features that contain information about the target period
- Ensures model only uses information available at prediction time

Data Leakage Rules:
1. LEAKY: Features that include target period data (e.g., Arıza_Sayısı_12ay for 12M prediction)
2. LEAKY: Aggregations calculated on target period data
3. LEAKY: Features derived from future knowledge
4. SAFE: Historical data from BEFORE prediction time
5. SAFE: Static attributes (age, equipment class, location, capacity)

Input:  data/features_selected.csv (~25-35 features)
Output: data/features_selected_clean.csv (~15-25 features)
